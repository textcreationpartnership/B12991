            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Neuerthelesse, His Maiestie hauing nothing more in His Princely desire, then the generall good of His Subiects, preferring their peace and quiet before His owne benefit, is now graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pleased once more to renew His sayd Commission to sundry of the Lords, and others of His Priuie Counsell, and others of His Iudges and Counsell learned, authorising them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to treate and compound on His Maiesties behalfe, for the selling, graunting, and confirming to such of His Subiects (whom it may concerne) as well their defectiue Titles, Estates and Possessions, in such Mannours and Lands, which they now pretend to hold, vnder colour of
<pb facs="tcp:185703:2"/>any defectiue, voyd, or insufficient Graunts, or by Letters Patents of Concealements. As for those Mannours and Lands which they possesse, and enioy meerely by Intrusion, and Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, without any colour of Right, and Title, they hauing had no Graunts thereof at all, either from his Maiestie, or any of his Predecessours, and yet not setled by the aforesayd Acte: His Maiestie expecting, that they will not now neglect this His grace offered, which if they shall doe, they must neither looke for further fauour from him, nor blame any but their owne negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences. And, that no man may pretend ignorance, how farre this grace extendeth, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie hath hereunto annexed an abstract of the said Commission, whereby each one (whom it concerneth) may take knowledge for what, and how hee may bee relieued, if in time, and by a due course he shall seeke the same. And his Maiestie doeth further declare his Royall pleasure to bee, that all persons (whom it may concerne) by this publique declaration of this His graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pleasure, either voluntarily of themselues, or vpon Letters to bee to them directed from His Maiesties Commissioners, with a draught of the particular cases, faile not at their perils to attend the said Commissioners, for such moderate and reasonable Compositions, as shall bee found fit, and equall for them.</p>
            <p>And His Maiestie, the better to bee informed who imbraceth this His Royall grace, and who neglecteth the same, Hath appointed and commanded <hi>Robert Typper,</hi> of Grayes Inne, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties seruant, to attend his Maiesties Commissioners, as in former times hee hath done, who is to acquaint his Maiesties sayd Commissioners with the State of the seuerall Cases, of those that shall seeke a Composition, as aforesaid; And who doe accept this his Maiesties grace, and who not, whereupon such further proceedings may be had for the maintaining of his Maiesties Right, and Title, and increasing of his Reuenew, as shall bee iust.</p>
